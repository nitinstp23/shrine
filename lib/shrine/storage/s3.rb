  module Storage
    # The S3 storage handles uploads to Amazon S3 service, it depends on the
    # [aws-sdk] gem:
    #
    #     gem "aws-sdk", "~> 2.1"
    #
    # It is initialized with the following 4 required options:
    #
    #     Shrine::Storage::S3.new(
    #       access_key_id: "xyz",
    #       secret_access_key: "abc",
    #       region: "eu-west-1",
    #       bucket: "my-app",
    #     )
    #
    # ## Prefix
    #
    # The `:prefix` option can be specified for uploading all files inside
    # a specific S3 prefix (folder), which is useful when using S3 for both
    # cache and store:
    #
    #     Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "cache", **s3_options)
    #     Shrine::Storage::S3.new(prefix: "store", **s3_options)
    #
    # ## Upload options
    #
    # Sometimes you'll want to add additional upload options to all S3 uploads.
    # You can do that by passing the `:upload` option:
    #
    #     Shrine::Storage::S3.new(
    #       upload_options: {acl: "public-read", cache_control: "public, max-age=3600"},
    #       **s3_options
    #     )
    #
    # These options will be passed to aws-sdk's methods for [uploading],
    # [copying] and [presigning].
    #
    # You can also generate upload options per upload with the `upload_options`
    # plugin:
    #
    #     class MyUploader < Shrine
    #       plugin :upload_options, store: ->(io, context) do
    #         if context[:version] == :thumb
    #           {acl: "public-read"}
    #         else
    #           {acl: "private"}
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Note that these aren't applied to presigns, since presigns are generated
    # using the storage directly.
    #
    # ## CDN
    #
    # If you're using a CDN with S3 like Amazon CloudFront, you can specify
    # the `:host` option to have all your URLs use the CDN host:
    #
    #     Shrine::Storage::S3.new(host: "http://abc123.cloudfront.net", **s3_options)
    #
    # ## Clearing cache
    #
    # If you're using S3 as a cache, you will probably want to periodically
    # delete old files which aren't used anymore. S3 has a built-in way to do
    # this, read [this article](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/lifecycle-configuration-bucket-no-versioning.html)
    # for instructions.
